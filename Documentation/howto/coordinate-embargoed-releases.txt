Abstract: When a vulnerability is reported, we follow these guidelines to
 assess the vulnerability, create and review a fix, and coordinate embargoed
 security releases.

The `git-security` mailing list
===============================

Responsible disclosures of vulnerabilities, analysis, proposed fixes as
well as the orchestration of coordinated embargoed releases all happen on the
`git-security` mailing list at <git-security@googlegroups.com>.

In this context, the term "embargo" refers to the time period that information
about a vulnerability is kept under wraps and only shared on a need-to-know
basis. This is necessary to protect Git's users from bad actors who would
otherwise be made aware of attack vectors that could be exploited. "Lifting the
embargo" refers to publishing the version that fixes the vulnerabilities.

Audience of the `git-security` mailing list
-------------------------------------------

Anybody may contact the `git-security` mailing list by sending an email
to <git-security@googlegroups.com>, though the archive is closed to the
public and only accessible to subscribed members.

There are a few dozen subscribed members: core Git developers who are trusted
with addressing vulnerabilities, and stakeholders (i.e. owners of products
affected by security vulnerabilities in Git).

Most of the discussions revolve around assessing the severity of the reported
bugs (including the decision whether the report is security-relevant or can be
redirected to the public mailing list), how to remediate the bug, determining
the timeline of the disclosure as well as aligning priorities and
requirements.

Communications
--------------

If you are a stakeholder, it is a good idea to pay close attention to the
discussions, as pertinent information may be buried in the middle of a lively
conversation that might not look relevant to your interests. For example, the
tentative timeline might be agreed upon in the middle of discussing code
comment formatting in one of the patches and whether or not to combine fixes
for multiple, separate vulnerabilities into the same embargoed release. Most
mail threads are not usually structured specifically to communicate
agreements, assessments or timelines.

A bug's life: Typical timeline
==============================

- A bug is reported to the `git-security` mailing list.

- Within a couple of days, someone from the core Git team responds with an
  initial assessment of the bugâ€™s severity.

- Other core developers - including the Git maintainer - chime in.

- After discussion, if consensus is reached that the bug is not critical enough
  to warrant any embargo, the reporter is redirected to the public Git mailing
  list. This ends the reporter's interaction with the `git-security` list.

- If the bug is critical enough for an embargo, ideas are presented on how to
  address the vulnerability.

- Usually around that time, the Git maintainer or their delegate(s) open a draft
  security advisory in the `git/git` repository on GitHub (see below for more
  details).

- Depending on the preferences of the involved contributors and reviewers, code
  review then happens either on the `git-security` mailing list or in a private
  fork associated with the draft security advisory.

- Once the review has settled and everyone involved in the review agrees that
  the patches are ready, the Git maintainer determines a release date as well
  as the release trains that are serviced. The decision regarding which versions
  need a backported fix is based on input from the reporter, the contributor who
  worked on the patches, and from stakeholders (e.g. operators of hosting sites
  who may want to analyze whether the given bug is exploited via any of the
  repositories they host).

- Subsequently, branches with the fixes are pushed to private repositories that
  are owned by the Git project, with tightly controlled access.

- The tags are created by the Git maintainer and pushed to the same
  repositories.

- Less than a week before the release, a mail with the relevant information is
  sent to <distros@vs.openwall.org> (see below), a list used to pre-announce embargoed
  releases of open source projects to the stakeholders of all major Linux
  distributions. This includes a Git bundle of the tagged version(s), but no
  further specifics of the vulnerability.

- Public communication is then prepared in advance of the release date. This
  includes blog posts and mails to the Git and Git for Windows mailing lists.

- The Git for Windows maintainer prepares the corresponding release artifacts,
  based on the tags created that have been prepared by the Git maintainer.

- Git for Windows release artifacts are made available under embargo to
  stakeholders via a mail to the `git-security` list.

- On the day of the release, at around 10am Pacific Time, the Git maintainer
  pushes the tag and the `master` branch to the public repository, then sends
  out an announcement mail.

- Once the tag is pushed, the Git for Windows maintainer publishes the
  corresponding tag and creates a GitHub Release with the associated release
  artifacts (Git for Windows installer, Portable Git, MinGit, etc).

- Git for Windows release is then announced via a mail to the public Git and
  Git for Windows mailing lists as well as via a tweet.

- A mail to <oss-security@lists.openwall.org> (see below for details) is sent as a
  follow-up to the <distros@vs.openwall.org> one, describing the vulnerability in
  detail, often including a proof of concept of an exploit.

Note: The Git project makes no guarantees about timelines, but aims to keep
embargoes reasonably short in the interest of keeping Git's users safe.

How we coordinate embargoed releases
====================================

To protect Git users from critical vulnerabilities, we do not just release
fixed versions like regular maintenance releases. Instead, we coordinate
releases with packagers, keeping the fixes under an embargo until the release
date. That way, users will have a chance to upgrade on that date, no matter
what Operating System or distribution they run.

Open a Security Advisory draft
------------------------------

The first step is to https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/new[open
an advisory]. Technically, this is not necessary. However, it is the most
convenient way to obtain the CVE number and it give us a private repository
associated with it that can be used to collaborate on a fix.

Notifying the Linux distributions
---------------------------------

At most two weeks before release date, we need to send a notification to
<distros@vs.openwall.org>, preferably less than 7 days before the release date.
This will reach most (all?) Linux distributions. See an example below, and the
guidelines for this mailing list at
https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists[here].

Once the version has been published, we send a note about that to oss-security.
As an example, see https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/13/1[the
v2.24.1 mail];
https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security[Here] are
their guidelines.

The mail to oss-security should also describe the exploit, and give credit to
the reporter(s): security researchers still receive too little respect for the
invaluable service they provide, and public credit goes a long way to keep them
paid by their respective organizations.

Technically, describing any exploit can be delayed up to 7 days, but we usually
refrain from doing that, including it right away.

As a courtesy we typically attach a Git bundle (as `.tar.xz` because the list
will drop `.bundle` attachments) in the mail to distros@ so that the involved
parties can take care of integrating/backporting them. This bundle is typically
created using a command like this:

	git bundle create cve-xxx.bundle ^origin/master vA.B.C vD.E.F
	tar cJvf cve-xxx.bundle.tar.xz cve-xxx.bundle

Subject: [vs] Upcoming Git security fix release

Team,

The Git project will release new versions on <date> at 10am Pacific Time or
soon thereafter. I have attached a Git bundle (embedded in a `.tar.xz` to avoid
it being dropped) which you can fetch into a clone of
https://github.com/git/git via `git fetch --tags /path/to/cve-xxx.bundle`,
containing the tags for versions <versions>.

You can verify with `git tag -v <tag>` that the versions were signed by
the Git maintainer, using the same GPG key as e.g. v2.24.0.

Please use these tags to prepare `git` packages for your various
distributions, using the appropriate tagged versions. The added test cases
help verify the correctness.
